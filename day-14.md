### Transform Syntax
- The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.
- The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.
## 2D Translate
- The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.
- It is common for multiple transforms to be used at once, rotating and scaling the size of an element at the same time 
# Animations
- Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.
- Once you have declared the animation-name property on an element, animations behave similarly to transitions. 
# Animation Iteration
- By default, animations run their cycle once from beginning to end and then stop. To have an animation repeat itself numerous times the animation-iteration-count property may be used
# Animation Fill Mode
- The animation-fill-mode property identifies how an element should be styled either before, after, or before and after an animation is run.
# Fade in
- Having things fade in is a fairly common request from clients. It’s a great way to emphasize functionality or draw attention to a call to action.
## Change color
- Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex, with all kinds of math involved in calculating separate RGB values and then recombining them.
## Grow & Shrink
- To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding. But now we can use CSS3’s transform to enlarge.
## Swing
- Not all elements use the transition property. We can also create highly complex animations using @keyframes, animation and animation-iteration.
