 ## Key concepts in positioning elements

- Building blocks

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own Box.

- If one block level element  sits inside another block level element then the outer Box if no 1 as it containing or parent element

- the position theme allow you to control the layout of a page

- Normal flow every block level element appears on a 
Causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one

- Relative conditioning this moves an element from the position it would be and normal flow shifting it to the top right bottom or left of where it would have been placed

 - Absolute positioning this positions the element in relation to its containing element

 - Fixed positioning this is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window as opposed to the containing element

 - Floating elements floating an element allows you to take their element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing Box

 Overlapping elements when you use relative fixed or absolute positioning boxes can overlap.

 - There are 2 layouts **fixed** with layouts and a **liquid layouts**
