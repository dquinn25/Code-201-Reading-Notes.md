- Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press Jane them and to use as a layout tool they're easier to look at and convey data quickly but they're not always easy to create

 ## Drawing Paths
 - A path is a list of points, connected by segments of lines that can be of different shapes, curved or not, of different width and of different color.

 - to draw arcs use arc()

 - the arc method, which takes six parameters: x and y are the coordinates of the center of the circle on which the arc should be drawn.

 - In addition to drawing opaque shapes to the canvas, we can also draw semi-transparent (or translucent) shapes. This is done by either setting the globalAlpha property or by assigning a semi-transparent color to the stroke and/or fill style.
